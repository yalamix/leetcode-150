# LeetCode 150

A repository of my solutions to the [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) list of problems from LeetCode.

## Notes
- All problems were done by myself, without consulting any outside sources. Everything straight out of my brain.
- I do not have a time limit to solve them.
- I'm doing this for fun and to keep my mind sharp as well as my coding skills.
- I always try to code up a solution that places me in the top result, but my initial solutions are also included, commented.
